    3 Types OF Operator
    1) Unary Operator:  Operators that act on one operand
    The expression of a+b has two elements; a&b are operands and + is an operator
    Operator act upon operands
    Example:2*2=4
     *&= are called operators and 2s&4 are called operands and a+b called as an expression

    2) Binary Operators: Operators that act on 2 operands
    3) Ternary OR Tertiary: Operators that act on 3 operands
